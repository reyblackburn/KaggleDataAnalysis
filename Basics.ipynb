    "## SUMMARY\n",
    "Looking at our analysis, we notice that the largest distribution of experience is with people with less than 5 years of experience.  Based on this observation, we have higher accuracy for people with less experience.  Comparing the average salary across our categories, we can conclude at with more experience there is an increase in salary. We could potentially run the analysis in groups of ten years instead of the difference by 5 years and see similar results, noticing that the averages are similar to each other."
